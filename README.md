# What is Fruit Rescue (Robot)

An app for managing the logistics of urban fruit harvesting. 
It is being built for [Community Fruit Rescue](http://fruitrescue.org) in Boulder, Colorado, 
in collaboration with [Code for Boulder](http://www.codeforboulder.org/) and [Falling Fruit](http://fallingfruit.org).

The overall purpose of the app is to: 
* Collect fruit tree owner and volunteer registrations.
* Facilitate communication with owners and volunteers.
* Plan, coordinate, and track fruit harvests and donations.
* Be generalized for easy adoption by similar organizations [across the globe](http://fallingfruit.org/sharing).
