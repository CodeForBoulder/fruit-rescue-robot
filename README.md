# What is Fruit Rescue (Robot)

A web app for managing the logistics of urban fruit harvesting. 
It is being built for [Community Fruit Rescue](http://fruitrescue.org) in Boulder, Colorado, 
by [Code for Boulder](http://www.codeforboulder.org/) and [Falling Fruit](http://fallingfruit.org).

The overall purpose of the app is to: 
* Collect homeowner, harvester, and fruit tree registrations.
* Facilitate communication with homeowners and harvesters.
* Plan, coordinate, and track harvests and donations.
* Be generalized for easy adoption by similar organizations [across the globe](http://fallingfruit.org/sharing).
